<h3>Welcome to interface help</h3>
This is currently a static document.

The <b>primary interface</b> for this game is <b>text</b>. The game will output text to you describing the situation, and will ask
you to type in a text response. This response is then parsed. The parser is looking for keywords that it recognizes. For
example, it knows the word "fight". But it also recognizes synonyms such as "combat" or "attack".
<br/><br/>
Once it finds some words it recognizes, depending on the type of the word, it will parse the rest of the message and try
to come up with an actionable statement. For example, if it finds "move" (or one of its synonyms, "go" or "proceed") it
will next start looking for a direction such as "east" or "west".
<br/><br/>
The parser:
<ul>
    <li>is NOT case sensitive ("EAST" is the same as "east")</li>
    <li>is NOT synonym sensitive ("go east" is the *exact* same as "move east")</li>
    <li>is NOT word-order sensitive ("east go" is the same as "go east")</li>
    <li>will IGNORE words it can't match ("I want my character to proceed east" is the same as "go east")</li>
</ul>

The parser is able to interpret "single and" statements and will attempt to execute the first side and then the second.
For example, "go east and fight the monsters" would be the same as typing "go east" and then "fight the monsters"
sequentially. And statements can't be combined with search or say statements right now. And statements cannot be nested
("go east and fight and loot"). <b>And statements may skip over some output.</b>
